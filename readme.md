# QMK keymap

## TODO: Add a couple of keys
- Control
- Alt
- Super key
- Funciton keys

## TODO: Make it easier to type a capital G

## Potential changes to fix these problems
- **Using either:**
  - Home row mods
  - [Mod taps](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/mod_tap)
  - [Combos](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_combo):
    - h + j -> sticky shift
    - j + k -> sticky control
    - k + l -> sticky alt
    - f + d -> sticky super

  So that I can have control, alt, the windows key, and shift on the letters. This would fix the lack of modifiers, and not being able to type capital G easily
- **Having the comma, period, and slash keys use combos on n, m, p and b instead of being in the sybols/numbers layer**

  This would make it easier to type basic punctuation, and free up space on the symbols and numbers layer for 6 functions keys, which could go from 1-6 normally, and go from 7-12 when shift is pressed. Combos for the same key locations could also be added for the symbols/numbers layer, so that you could still enter numbers with decimals easily.
- **Copying the combos on the base layer for navigation onto the same places on the symbols/numbers layer**
  
  This would allow for easier navigation when entering symbols, and numbers
- **Moving the G that is on the right thumb cluster to the left thumb cluster**

  This would make it much easier to type a capital G
- **Using auto shift**

  This would fix the difficulty in typing a capital G, but does introduce a delay to type capitals

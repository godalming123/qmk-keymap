# QMK keymap

## TODO: Add a couple of keys
- Super key
- Funciton keys

## Potential changes to fix these problems
- **Add super using either:**
  - Home row mods
  - [Combos](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_combo):
    - h + j -> super

- **Having the comma, period, and slash keys use combos on n, m, p and b instead of being in the symbols/numbers layer**

  This would make it easier to type basic punctuation, and free up space on the symbols and numbers layer for 6 functions keys, which could go from 1-6 normally, and go from 7-12 when shift is pressed. Combos for the same key locations could also be added for the symbols/numbers layer, so that you could still enter numbers with decimals easily.
- **Copying the combos on the base layer for navigation onto the same places on the symbols/numbers layer**
  
  This would allow for easier navigation when entering symbols, and numbers
